## Features

### **Hybrid-Cloud Security & Governance**

* Hybrid-cloud compliance:  
   Continuously monitor compliance for multiple clouds with many compliance frameworks, such as Guarantee 2.0, CIS ,HPPA, and some best practice, we also support customizable rules;
* Cloud resource visualization:  
  Synchronize resources on the cloud, and quickly view various resource situations and cloud resource topology diagrams of the hybrid cloud;
* Vulnerability detection:   
  Detect vulnerability base on the vulnerability Database, the security vulnerability of network devices and application services is detected by scanning
* Compliance report:  
  One-click to get the compliance reports with fully vision of the security situation;
* Operation audit:  
  Unified monitoring of account activities for Hybrid-cloud environment, and auditing the operation logs of the cloud.

* K8S resource situation:  
   You can associate multiple K8S clusters,then view the resource situation in a unified panel;
* Host detection:  
   You can customize the detection content to find problems in the underlying host or virtual machine;
* K8s detection:     
   According to the K8S security baseline, and found the existence of misconfiguration , vulnerabilities, dangerous actions, etc.;
* Deployment detection:  
   Detect K8S deployment orchestration files and discover configuration problems before deployment;
* Image detection:  
   Comprehensive detection vulnerabilities in image, including operating systems, software packages, application dependencies, etc.;
* Source code detection:  
   Detect the developer's source code, and discover open source protocols, dependencies vulnerabilities;
* File detection:  
   Upload specific language files or folders in source code projects, and discover application-dependent vulnerability;
* SBOM management:  
   Visual management and analysis of SBOM, manage SBOM drift, quickly discover and locate risks and vulnerabilities in the software supply chain, and give suggest remediation.
